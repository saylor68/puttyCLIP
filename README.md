# puttyCLIP
AHK script that stores dblclicked words to a temp file notepad on desktop. If you click INSIDE the notepad, the Paste action is hard coded to send to the PuTTY window.
you can manually edit the destination in the script.
you can double click in MOST windows and copy the word underneath the pointer. Office apps sometimes get stupid.
does not currently capture ctrl-c or etc, only left double clicks of the mouse.
have fun -
